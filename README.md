# RCE (RaylibComponentEngine)
## About
This engine is built on top of the existing awesome game making library [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/). <br>
This framework uses CMake build system. <br>
I started building this library because I created a small game in unity, but I missed pointers and I didn't like the API, so I decided to build this (probably bug filled) framework, with the goal of making it as generic as I can, with people being able to create components and scenes using some simple `IScenes` and `IObjectComponent` interfaces (maybe) using the wonderful ideology of OOP.
